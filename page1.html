Lets have a barrel of fun<br/>
Roll out the Arsenal<br/>
We've got them all on the run<br/>
Just one more goal now<br/>
Then how we all will cheer 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,<br/>
The Gang's all here<br/>
<br/>
You are my Arsenal<br/>
You are my Arsenal,<br/>
My only Arsenal,<br/>
You make me happy,<br/>
When skies are grey,<br/>
You'll never know just,<br/>
How much I love you,<br/>
So please don't take,<br/>
My Arsenal...Away<br/>

But Arsenal we love you<br/>

Who's that team they call the Arsenal?<br/>
Who's that team we all adore?<br/>
They're the boys in red and white,<br/>
and they fight with all their might,<br/>
and they're out to show the world just how to score!"<br/>

    NOISY NEIGHBOURS
  </h1>
  <p>
    Blue Moon<br/>
You saw me standing alone<br/>
Without a dream in my heart<br/>
Without a love of my own<br/>
<br/>
My father said to me one day "is it red or blue for you?"<br/>
and if it's red you're out the door and I won't see you no more<br/>
and then one Saturday afternoon he took me to Moss Side<br/>
He said "my son your time has come and this is a lesson in pride"<br/>
You see the scum you never run<br/>
You stand and fight your ground<br/>
and when you've won on derby day <br/>
You're sure to hear this sound<br/>
Hark now hear<br/>
The City sing<br/>
United ran away<br/>
And we will fight for ever more<br/>
Because of Derby day<br/>
<br/>
We never win at home<br/>
and we never win away<br/>
We lost last week<br/>
and we lost today<br/>
We don't give a fuck<br/>
'Cos we're all pissed up<br/>
MCFC OK<br/>
I never felt more like singing the Blues<br/>
City win, United lose<br/>
Oh City<br/>
You've got me singing the blues<br/>
<br/>
City 'til I die<br/>
I'm City 'til I die<br/>
I know I am<br/>
I'm sure I am<br/>
I'm City 'til I die<br/>
<br/>
We are City<br/>
We are City<br/>
Super City<br/>
from Maine Road<br/>
We are City<br/>
Super City<br/>
We are City from Maine Road<br/>
<br/>
We all follow Man City<br/>
Over land and sea<br/>
and Stretford<br/>
We all follow the City<br/>
On to victory<br/>
<br/>
You are my City<br/>
My only City<br/>
You make me happy<br/>
When skys are grey<br/>
You'll never know just<br/>
How much I love you<br/>
So please dont take my City away<br/>
<br/>
We are not, we're not really here<br/>
We are not, we're not really here<br/>
Just like the fan of the Invisible man we're not really here<br/>
<br/>
In 1963 when we fell to Division Two<br/>
The Stretford End cried out aloud<br/>
'It's the end for you Sky Blue'<br/>
Joe Mercer came<br/>
We played the game<br/>
We went to Rotherham<br/>
And won 1 0<br/>
And we were back into Division One<br/>
We've won the League we've won the Cup<br/>
We've been to Europe too<br/>
And when we win the League again<br/>
We'll sing this song to you<br/>
City City City City City<br/>
<br/>
City City<br/>
The best team in the land <br/>
and all the world<br/>
<br/>
And it's Manchester City<br/>
Manchester City FC<br/>
We're by far the greatest team<br/>
the world has ever seen<br/>
<br/>
City - Manchester City<br/>
We are the lads who are playing to win<br/>
City - the Boys in Blue will never give in<br/>
Football is the game that we all live for<br/>
Saturday is the day we play the game<br/>
Everybody has to pull together<br/>
And together we will stand<br/>
Even if we're playing down at Maine Road<br/>
Or if we play a million miles away<br/>
There will always be our loyal fans behind us<br/>
To cheer us on our way<br/>
City - Manchester City<br/>
We are the lads who are playing to win<br/>
City - the Boys in Blue will never give in<br/>
Blue and white we play together<br/>
We will carry on forever more<br/>
Maybe in another generation<br/>
When other lads have come to take our place<br/>
They'll carry on the glory of the City<br/>
Keeping City in the place<br/>
City - Manchester City<br/>
We are the lads who are playing to win<br/>
City - the Boys in Blue will never give in<br/>
City - the Boys in Blue will never give in <br/>
City - the Boys in Blue will never give in
