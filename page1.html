    Good old Arsenal,
Good old Arsenal,

And while we sing this song,
we'll win the game.

Vieira wo o e o, Vieira wo o eo,

Vieira wo o e o, Vieira

He's blond, Hes quick
His names a porno flick,
emmanuel, emmanuel

One-nil to the Arsenal,
One-nil to the Arsenal,
One-nil to the Arsenal,
One-nil to the Arsenal,
One-nil to the Arsenal!
(repeat)

We`ll win coz we`re Arsenal,
We`ll win coz we`re Arsenal,
We`ll win coz we`re Arsenal,
We`ll win coz we`re Arsenal!
(repeat)
Que sera sera
Que sera sera
what ever will be will be
we`re going to Wemberly
que sera sera.


Roll out the Arsenal
Roll out the Arsenal
Lets have a barrel of fun
Roll out the Arsenal
We've got them all on the run
Just one more goal now
Then how we all will cheer 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,
The Gang's all here

You are my Arsenal
You are my Arsenal,
My only Arsenal,
You make me happy,
When skies are grey,
You'll never know just,
How much I love you,
So please don't take,
My Arsenal...Away
Na na na na na (ooh)
Na na na na na (ooh ooh)
na na na na na...

We hate Nottingham Forest
We hate Liverpool too
We hate West Ham United
But Arsenal we love you

Who's that team they call the Arsenal?
Who's that team we all adore?
They're the boys in red and white,
and they fight with all their might,
and they're out to show the world just how to score!"

    NOISY NEIGHBOURS

    Blue Moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

My father said to me one day "is it red or blue for you?"
and if it's red you're out the door and I won't see you no more
and then one Saturday afternoon he took me to Moss Side
He said "my son your time has come and this is a lesson in pride"
You see the scum you never run
You stand and fight your ground
and when you've won on derby day 
You're sure to hear this sound
Hark now hear
The City sing
United ran away
And we will fight for ever more
Because of Derby day

We never win at home
and we never win away
We lost last week
and we lost today
We don't give a fuck
'Cos we're all pissed up
MCFC OK

I never felt more like singing the Blues
City win, United lose
Oh City
You've got me singing the blues

City 'til I die
I'm City 'til I die
I know I am
I'm sure I am
I'm City 'til I die

We are City
We are City
Super City
from Maine Road
We are City
Super City
We are City from Maine Road

We all follow Man City
Over land and sea
and Stretford
We all follow the City
On to victory

You are my City
My only City
You make me happy
When skys are grey
You'll never know just
How much I love you
So please dont take my City away

We are not, we're not really here
We are not, we're not really here
Just like the fan of the Invisible man we're not really here

In 1963 when we fell to Division Two
The Stretford End cried out aloud
'It's the end for you Sky Blue'
Joe Mercer came
We played the game
We went to Rotherham
And won 1 0
And we were back into Division One
We've won the League we've won the Cup
We've been to Europe too
And when we win the League again
We'll sing this song to you
City City City City City

City City
The best team in the land 
and all the world

And it's Manchester City
Manchester City FC
We're by far the greatest team
the world has ever seen

City - Manchester City
We are the lads who are playing to win
City - the Boys in Blue will never give in
Football is the game that we all live for
Saturday is the day we play the game
Everybody has to pull together
And together we will stand
Even if we're playing down at Maine Road
Or if we play a million miles away
There will always be our loyal fans behind us
To cheer us on our way
City - Manchester City
We are the lads who are playing to win
City - the Boys in Blue will never give in
Blue and white we play together
We will carry on forever more
Maybe in another generation
When other lads have come to take our place
They'll carry on the glory of the City
Keeping City in the place
City - Manchester City
We are the lads who are playing to win
City - the Boys in Blue will never give in
City - the Boys in Blue will never give in 
City - the Boys in Blue will never give in
