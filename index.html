    <p>
      When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high<br/>
      And don't be afraid of the dark<br/>
      At the end of the storm, there's a golden sky<br/>
      And the sweet, silver song of a lark<br/>
      Walk on through the wind<br/>
      Walk on through the rain<br/>
      Though your dreams be tossed and blown<br/>
      Walk on, walk on<br/>
      With hope in your hearts<br/>
      And you'll never walk alone<br/>
      You'll never walk alone<br/>
      Walk on, walk on<br/>
      With hope in your hearts<br/>
      And you'll never walk alone<br/>
      You'll never walk alone<br/>

      CHELSEA
    </h1>
    <p>
      Out from The Shed came a rising young star,<br/>
      scoring goals past Pat Jennings from near and from far,<br/>
      When Cheslea won as we all knew they would,<br/>
      The star of that great team was Peter Osgood,<br/>
      Osgood, Osgood<br/>
      Osgood, Osgood<br/>
      Born is the king of Stamford Bridge!<br/>
