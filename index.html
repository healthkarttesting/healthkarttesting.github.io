      You saw me standing alone<br/>
      Without a dream in my heart<br/>
      Without a love of my own<br/>
      <br/>
      My father said to me one day "is it red or blue for you?"<br/>
      and if it's red you're out the door and I won't see you no more<br/>
      and then one Saturday afternoon he took me to Moss Side<br/>
      He said "my son your time has come and this is a lesson in pride"<br/>
      You see the scum you never run<br/>
      You stand and fight your ground<br/>
      and when you've won on derby day <br/>
      You're sure to hear this sound<br/>
      Hark now hear<br/>
      The City sing<br/>
      United ran away<br/>
      And we will fight for ever more<br/>
      Because of Derby day<br/>
      <br/>
      We never win at home<br/>
      and we never win away<br/>

      In 1963 when we fell to Division Two<br/>
      The Stretford End cried out aloud<br/>
      'It's the end for you Sky Blue'<br/>
      Joe Mercer came<br/>
      We played the game<br/>
      We went to Rotherham<br/>
      And won 1 0<br/>

      Even if we're playing down at Maine Road<br/>
      Or if we play a million miles away<br/>
      There will always be our loyal fans behind us<br/>
      To cheer us on our way<br/>

      Blue and white we play together<br/>
      We will carry on forever more<br/>
      Maybe in another generation<br/>
      When other lads have come to take our place<br/>
      They'll carry on the glory of the City<br/>
      Keeping City in the place<br/>
