Welcome to old Trafford it's the theatre of our dreams
Were ready to die were ready to fight
It's part of our history
The power and the glory
Oh the Stretford End will sing
As the reds go marching On On On

Glory, glory, Man United
Glory, glory, Man United
Glory, glory, Man United
As The Reds Go Marching On On On

With Rooney and Ronaldo and the magic at their feet.
There's no competition
In the English Premier League
We're the Champions of the World
And were the greatest football team
As the reds go marching On On On

Glory, glory, Man United
Glory, glory, Man United
Glory, glory, Man United
As The Reds Go Marching On On On

And now we are the champions and there's no one left to beat.
We've finished off the scousers 
And Silenced the Mersey Beat
Ryan Giggs we love you
Gary Neville you are the best
As The Reds Go Marching On On On

Glory, glory, Man United
Glory, glory, Man United

    LOSERPOOL
  </h1>
  <p>
    When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm, there's a golden sky
And the sweet, silver song of a lark
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your hearts
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your hearts
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
  </p>
  <h1>
    CHELSEA
  </h1>
  <p>
    Out from The Shed came a rising young star,
scoring goals past Pat Jennings from near and from far,
When Cheslea won as we all knew they would,
The star of that great team was Peter Osgood,
Osgood, Osgood
Osgood, Osgood
Born is the king of Stamford Bridge!
